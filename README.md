# Decision Transformer for CarRacing-v2

This repository contains the implementation and trained models of a Decision Transformer, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm, for the CarRacing-v2 environment.

## Overview

The Decision Transformer is a model that reformulates reinforcement learning as a sequence modeling problem. It uses transformer architecture to predict actions based on past states, actions, and rewards. This repository includes a pretrained model and code to train new models using the stable_baselines3 framework.

## Getting Started
